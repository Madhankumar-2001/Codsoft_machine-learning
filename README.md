#MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
---------------------------
In this task I have created a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Also we can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

#CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
------------------------------
In this task I have developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.
